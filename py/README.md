# Python 3 Implementation of Conway's Game of Life

See [the repo's README](../README.md) for details of the game.

This Python implementation is meant to reinforce my learning undertaken in 25Q3, specifically the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/) [videos](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAcTmDO6NTI&list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB).

First cut will be simple output to a console, nothing fancy. Probably won't pull in any real dependencies, and my python env is just the Ubuntu machine I'm running on.

I will get some tests in the mix using pytest, so that may require a bit of dependency management. And I'll follow some kinda guide for setting up VSCode to run Python code nicely.
